Changes from 1.0 to 2.0
=======================

You should expect to see noticeable changes in the characteristics of the
following benchmarks: bodytrack, canneal, dedup and x264.

It is possible that the characteristics of all other programs that were updated
have changed, too. The only guarantee for identical characteristics is an
identical source code (assuming everything else also remains the same).
