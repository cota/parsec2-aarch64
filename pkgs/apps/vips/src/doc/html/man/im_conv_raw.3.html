<h2><a name='sect2' href='#toc2'>Description</a></h2>
These functions convolve the image
pointed by the image descriptor in with the file pointed by mask and puts
the result in the image pointed by out. The mask structures INTMASK and
DOUBLEMASK are  returned by the function <a href='im_read_imask.3.html'>im_read_imask(3)</a>
 or <a href='im_read_dmask.3.html'>im_read_dmask(3)</a>
,
for integer and double masks respectively. 
<p> Input should be non-complex. 
 The size and type of the output image are the same as the size of the
input.   To output a larger type (for example, to output an int image from
convolution of a byte image, avoiding clipping), cast the input image up
with one of the im_clip2*() functions. 
<p> If the sizes of the mask are xm
and ym and the sizes of the image are xs and ys, then there is a black
border at the output image as follows: 
<p> The top ym/2 lines black, bottom
ys-ym/2-ym lines black; each of the remaining lines has the initial xm/2
pels blank, and the final xs-xm/2-xm pels (division over 2 is integer division).

<p> The output at each point is divided by scale and then the offset is added.
Both offset and scale are held in mask. 
<p> <b>im_conv()</b> and <b>im_convsep()</b> have
&rsquo;raw&rsquo; versions which do not add the black border: instead the output image
is smaller than the input. 
<p> <b>im_conv()</b> and <b>im_conv_raw()</b> convolve any non-complex
input image to make an output image of the same type. Rounding is appropriate
to the image type. 
<p> <b>im_convf()</b> convolves to float (double if the input is
double). The function expects a double mask. 
<p> <b>im_convsep()</b> and  <b>im_convsep_raw()</b>
carry out convolution using an 1xN or Nx1 separable mask.   
<p> The function
scales the output result by dividing it with scale*scale. The scale factor
should therefore be the sqrt of the scale of the square NxN mask. 
<p> Rounding
is appropriate to the image type.  It works on any non-complex image, and
writes the output in the same format as the input. The function expects
integer mask. 
<p> <b>im_convsepf()</b> convolves to float (double if the input is
double). The function expects a double mask. 
<p> <b>im_convsub()</b> convolves the
byte image pointed by in and writes the result as a byte output. Using this
function the input image is subsampled on both directions by an integer
factor of xskip horizontally and an integer factor of yskip vertically.
During the covolution, values are rounded before division. Both input and
output are bytes.  Output is clipped between 0 and 255. The function expects
an integer mask. 
<p> <b>im_shrink()</b> shrink the input image file by xfactor along
the horizontal and yfactor along the vertical direction.  The function doesnot
perform subpixel interpolation and therefore the resultant image can present
aliasing especially for small x and y factors. Any size image, any non-complex
type, any number of bands. 
<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Return Value</a></h2>
The function returns 0 on success
and -1 on error.
