<h2><a name='sect2' href='#toc2'>Description</a></h2>
<b>im_fwfft()</b> performs a forward fast Fourier
Transform on the image held by the image descriptor in and writes the result
to the image descriptor out. The image can be in any format and have any
number of bands. The output is always complex. 
<p> If VIPS has been built with
support for libfftw, a high-speed FFT library, then fftwnd_one() is used
to compute the transform. This produces a double precision complex result.
The first transformation at a particular image size will be very slow as
libfftw optimises itself for your machine, but subsequent transforms of
images of that size are extremely fast. Unfortunately, libfftw does not
have good out-of-memory behaviour. If you try to transform a very large image,
your program will exit abruptly. 
<p> If VIPS has not been built with libfftw
support, VIPS uses its own fft routines. These are rather slow, are single
precision only, and can only transform images whose sides are a power of
two. 
<p> <b>im_invfft()</b> performs the reverse transform. The input image must be
complex, the output is always complex. The image may have any number of
bands. 
<p> Again, if libfftw was present when VIPS was compiled, that library
is used to calculate the transform. 
<p> <b>im_invfftr()</b> performs the reverse transform.
The input image must be complex, the output is always real. The image may
have any number of bands. It is about 2 x faster than <b>im_invfft().</b> 
<p> Again,
if libfftw was present when VIPS was compiled, that library is used to
calculate the transform.
