/* Analyse a grid of colour patches, producing a DOUBLEMASK of averages.
 * Pass an IMAGE, an IMAGE_BOX, the number of horizontal and vertical
 * patches, an array giving the numbers of the patches to measure (patches are
 * numbered left-to-right, top-to-bottom) and the name we should give the
 * output mask. Return a DOUBLEMASK in which rows are patches and columns are 
 * bands. 
 *
 * Example: 6 band image of 4x2 block of colour patches.
 * 
 *	+---+---+---+---+
 *	| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
 *	+---+---+---+---+
 *	| 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
 *	+---+---+---+---+
 *
 * Then call im_measure( im, box, 4, 2, { 2, 4 }, 2, "fred" ) makes a mask
 * "fred" which has 6 columns, two rows. The first row contains the averages
 * for patch 2, the second for patch 4.
 *
 * Modified: 
 * 19/8/94 JC
 *	- now uses doubles for addressing
 *	- could miss by up to h pixels previously!
 *	- ANSIfied
 *	- now issues warning if any deviations are greater than 20% of the
 *	  mean
 * 31/10/95 JC
 *	- more careful about warning for averages <0, or averages near zero
 *	- can get these cases with im_measure() of IM_TYPE_LAB images
 * 28/10/02 JC
 *	- number bands from zero in error messages
 * 7/7/04
 *	- works on labq
